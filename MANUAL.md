Here's my "manual for me", so that you know what to expect.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è A quick background

- Born in Leeds. Currently living in Leeds.
- Went to the [University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/). Got a BSc (Hons) in Computing and Cybernetics. It's not as cool as it sounds.
- Worked at the university, building things to improve the IT user experience, and then later working on [research metadata management](http://orbital.dev.lincoln.ac.uk).
- Went to work for [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/), empowering people in their democracies. Did quite a lot of work on [data about politicians](https://everypolitician.org/).
- Currently at [dxw](https://www.dxw.com/), building great public services to improve lives.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Working with me

### üíª Conditions I like to work in

I usually work a hybrid of home, coffee shops and office, depending on what needs doing. I can work almost anywhere as long as the noise level is consistent. It doesn't matter if it's consistently quiet or consistently loud, as long as there aren't sudden changes every few seconds.

Music is good. I tend to prefer things without vocals when I'm working, but that isn't a hard and fast rule.

### üï§ The times/hours I like to work

I generally work from 9:30am until 6:00pm.

I do have children in school, so often need flexibility around school drop-off and pick-up times.

I use [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to proactively block time out in my calendar for things, but that doesn't mean I won't be able to move things around to make way for something important.

### üí¨ The best ways to communicate with me

The best way to reach me ‚Äì at least at first ‚Äì is asynchronously. Drop me a message in Slack. If I'm not busy I'm usually quite happy to jump on a call, just message me first to check.

I only check my emails a few times a day, so they're great for things I need to know or need to take an action on _eventually_, but not great for something which needs a rapid response.

In an open-plan office I may be wearing headphones. If so then it doesn't always mean I'm not interruptable, I might just be listening to something. I'd prefer you messaged me to check if I'm able to talk, but if I say "yes" then just wander over for a chat.

### ‚úîÔ∏è The ways I like to receive feedback

Get straight to the point. I'd rather receive feedback clearly and promptly, especially if it's something I need to be doing differently.

### ‚ûï Things I need

Clarity around what I'm doing and why. I often ask lots of questions to get an understanding of the reasons for something, especially in complex systems.

### ‚ûñ Things I struggle with

I don't do well with meetings which should really be emails. I have no problem attending (and often quite enjoy) meetings where we're actually unpicking problems or making decisions, but otherwise I'll usually have trouble staying focussed.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Things I love

Good documentation, be that of the work left to be done, the process, the design of a system, or anything else.

I enjoy a good animated gif, and will apply them liberally in both chat channels and presentations.

## üìá Other things to know about me

- My pronouns are [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he).
- I can be quite extroverted when needed, so I'm usually quite happy to do things like show-and-tells.
- I try to live a somewhat [green existence](https://nickjackson.me/green).
- I take part in [amateur dramatics](http://whitkirkartsguild.com/) and [choral singing](https://leedsmalevoicechoir.co.uk/), if you really want to see me on stage.
