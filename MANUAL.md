# A manual for Nick

Here's my "manual for me", so that you know what to expect if you're working with me.

## Conditions I like

I like to have a plan, even if we all know the plan is going to change.

## Times I like to work

I have two small children, so my hours often need to be flexible around school drop-off and pick-up times. Other than that, I work a fairly normal day.

## Ways to communicate with me

I prefer asynchronous communications. The best way to get in touch is usually to drop me a message on Slack, but you can always email me and I'll get around to it when I've got a free moment.

## Ways I like to receive feedback

Just tell me. I'm very hard to offend.
