# A manual for Nick

Here's my "manual for me", so that you know what to expect if you're working with me.

## üíª Conditions I like to work in

I can work almost anywhere as long as the noise level is consistent. It doesn't matter if it's consistently quiet or consistently loud, as long as there aren't sudden changes every few seconds.

Music is good. I tend to prefer things without vocals when I'm working, but that isn't a hard and fast rule.

## üï§ The times/hours I like to work

I generally work from 9:30am until 6:00pm.

I do have children in school, so often need flexibility around school drop-off and pick-up times.

I use [reclaim.ai](https://reclaim.ai/) to proactively block time out in my calendar for things, but that doesn't mean I won't be able to move things around to make way for something important.

## üí¨ The best ways to communicate with me

The best way to reach me ‚Äì at least initially ‚Äì is asynchronously. Drop me a message in Slack. If I'm not busy I'm usually quite happy to jump on a call, just message me first to check.

I only check my emails a few times a day, so they're great for things I need to know or need to take an action on _eventually_, but not great for something which needs a rapid response.

In an open-plan office I may be wearing headphones. If so then it doesn't always mean I'm not interruptable, I might just be listening to something in the background. I'd prefer you messaged me to check if I'm able to talk, but if I say "yes" then just wander over for a chat.

## ‚úîÔ∏è The ways I like to receive feedback

Get straight to the point. I'd rather receive feedback clearly and promptly, especially if it's something I need to be doing differently.

## ‚ûï Things I need

Clarity around what I'm doing and why. I often ask lots of questions to get an understanding of the reasons for something, especially in complex systems.

## ‚ûñ Things I struggle with

I don't do well with meetings which should really be emails. I have no problem attending (and often quite enjoy) meetings where we're actually unpicking problems or making decisions, but otherwise I'll usually have trouble staying focussed.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Things I love

Good documentation, be that of the work left to be done, the process, the design of a system, or anything else.

## üìá Other things to know about me

- I can be quite extroverted when needed, so I'm usually quite happy to do things like show-and-tells.
- I love a good animated gif, and will apply them liberally in both chat channels and presentations.
- My pronouns are [he/him/his](https://pronoun.is/he).
